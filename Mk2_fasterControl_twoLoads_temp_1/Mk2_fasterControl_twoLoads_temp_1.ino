/* Mk2_fasterControl_twoLoads_2.ino
 *
 *  (initially released as Mk2_bothDisplays_1 in March 2014)
 * This sketch is for diverting suplus PV power to a dump load using a triac or  
 * Solid State Relay. It is based on the Mk2i PV Router code that I have posted in on  
 * the OpenEnergyMonitor forum.  The original version, and other related material, 
 * can be found on my Summary Page at www.openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/1757
 *
 * In this latest version, the pin-allocations have been changed to suit my 
 * PCB-based hardware for the Mk2 PV Router.  The integral voltage sensor is 
 * fed from one of the secondary coils of the transformer.  Current is measured 
 * via Current Transformers at the CT1 and CT1 ports.  
 * 
 * CT1 is for 'grid' current, to be measured at the grid supply point.
 * CT2 is for the load current, so that diverted energy can be recorded
 *
 * A persistence-based 4-digit display is supported. This can be driven in two
 * different ways, one with an extra pair of logic chips, and one without.  The 
 * appropriate version of the sketch must be selected by including or commenting 
 * out the "#define PIN_SAVING_HARDWARE" statement near the top of the code.
 *
 * September 2014: renamed as Mk2_bothDisplays_2, with these changes:
 * - cycleCount removed (was not actually used in this sketch, but could have overflowed);
 * - removal of unhelpful comments in the IO pin section;
 * - tidier initialisation of display logic in setup();
 * - addition of REQUIRED_EXPORT_IN_WATTS logic (useful as a built-in PV simulation facility);
 *
 * December 2014: renamed as Mk2_bothDisplays_3, with these changes:
 * - persistence check added for zero-crossing detection (polarityConfirmed)
 * - lowestNoOfSampleSetsPerMainsCycle added, to check for any disturbances
 *
 * December 2014: renamed as Mk2_bothDisplays_3a, with some typographical errors fixed.
 *
 * January 2016: renamed as Mk2_bothDisplays_3b, with a minor change in the ISR to 
 *   remove a timing uncertainty.
 *
 * January 2016: updated to Mk2_bothDisplays_3c:
 *   The variables to store the ADC results are now declared as "volatile" to remove 
 *   any possibility of incorrect operation due to optimisation by the compiler.
 *
 * February 2016: updated to Mk2_bothDisplays_4, with these changes:
 * - improvements to the start-up logic.  The start of normal operation is now 
 *    synchronised with the start of a new mains cycle.
 * - reduce the amount of feedback in the Low Pass Filter for removing the DC content
 *     from the Vsample stream. This resolves an anomaly which has been present since 
 *     the start of this project.  Although the amount of feedback has previously been 
 *     excessive, this anomaly has had minimal effect on the system's overall behaviour.
 * - removal of the unhelpful "triggerNeedsToBeArmed" mechanism
 * - tidying of the "confirmPolarity" logic to make its behaviour more clear
 * - SWEETZONE_IN_JOULES changed to WORKING_RANGE_IN_JOULES 
 * - change "triac" to "load" wherever appropriate
 *
 * November 2019: updated to Mk2_fasterControl_1 with these changes:
 * - Half way through each mains cycle, a prediction is made of the likely energy level at the
 *   end of the cycle.  That predicted value allows the triac to be switched at the +ve going 
 *   zero-crossing point rather than waiting for a further 10 ms.  These changes allow for 
 *   faster switching of the load.
 * - The range of the energy bucket has been reduced to one tenth of its former value. This
 *   allows the unit's operation to commence more rapidly whenever surplus power is available.
 * - controlMode is no longer selectable, the unit's operation being effectively hard-coded 
 *   as "Normal" rather than Anti-flicker. 
 * - Port D3 now supports an indicator which shows when the level in the energy bucket
 *   reaches either end of its range.  While the unit is actively diverting surplus power,
 *   it is vital that the level in the reduced capacity energy bucket remains within its 
 *   permitted range, hence the addition of this indicator.
 *   
 * February 2020: updated to Mk2_fasterControl_twoLoads_1 with these changes:
 * - the energy overflow indicator has been disabled to free up port D3 
 * - port D3 now supports a second load
 * 
 * February 2020: updated to Mk2_fasterControl_twoLoads_2 with these changes:
 * - improved multi-load control logic to prevent the primary load from being disturbed by
 *   the lower priority one.  This logic now mirrors that in the Mk2_multiLoad_wired_n line.

// Calibration values
//-------------------
// Two calibration values are used: powerCal and phaseCal.
// A full explanation of each of these values now follows:
//
// powerCal is a floating point variable which is used for converting the
// product of voltage and current samples into Watts.
//
// The correct value of powerCal is dependent on the hardware that is
// in use.  For best resolution, the hardware should be configured so that the
// voltage and current waveforms each span most of the ADC's usable range.  For
// many systems, the maximum power that will need to be measured is around 3kW.
//
// My sketch "RawSamplesTool_2chan.ino" provides a one-shot visual display of the
// voltage and current waveforms.  This provides an easy way for the user to be
// confident that their system has been set up correctly for the power levels
// that are to be measured.
//
// The ADC has an input range of 0-5V and an output range of 0-1023 levels.
// The purpose of each input sensor is to convert the measured parameter into a
// low-voltage signal which fits nicely within the ADC's input range.
//
// In the case of 240V mains voltage, the numerical value of the input signal
// in Volts is likely to be fairly similar to the output signal in ADC levels.
// 240V AC has a peak-to-peak amplitude of 679V, which is not far from the ideal
// output range.  Stated more formally, the conversion rate of the overall system
// for measuring VOLTAGE is likely to be around 1 ADC-step per Volt (RMS).
//
// In the case of AC current, however, the situation is very different.  At
// mains voltage, a power of 3kW corresponds to an RMS current of 12.5A which
// has a peak-to-peak range of 35A.  This is smaller than the output signal by
// around a factor of twenty.  The conversion rate of the overall system for
// measuring CURRENT is therefore likely to be around 20 ADC-steps per Amp.
//
// When calculating "real power", which is what this code does, the individual
// conversion rates for voltage and current are not of importance.  It is
// only the conversion rate for POWER which is important.  This is the
// product of the individual conversion rates for voltage and current.  It
// therefore has the units of ADC-steps squared per Watt.  Most systems will
// have a power conversion rate of around 20 (ADC-steps squared per Watt).
//
// powerCal is the RECIPR0CAL of the power conversion rate.  A good value
// to start with is therefore 1/20 = 0.05 (Watts per ADC-step squared)
