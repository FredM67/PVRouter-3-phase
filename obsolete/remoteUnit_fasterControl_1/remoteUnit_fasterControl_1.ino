/* remoteUnit_fasterControl_1.ino
 *
 * This sketch is to control a remote load for a Mk2 PV Router at the receiver end
 * of an RF link.  If RF transmission is lost, the load is turned off.  A repeater
 * signal is available at the 'mode' connector.  This is intended to drive an LED
 * with an appropriate series resistor, e.g. 120R. 
 *
 * The ability to measure and display the amount of energy which has been diverted 
 * via the remote load is included.  For this to happen, one of the live cores
 * needs to pass through a CT which connects to the 'CT2' connector.  
 *
 * The 'CT1' connector has been re-used in this sketch to provide a 2-colour 
 * indication of the state of the RF link.  A schematic for this circuit may be 
 * found immediately below this header.
 *
 * A persistence-based 4-digit display is supported. When the RFM12B module is 
 * in use, the display can only be used in conjunction with an extra pair of 
 * logic chips.  These are ICs 3 and 4, which reduce the number of processor pins 
 * that are needed to drive the display.
 *
 * This sketch is similar in function to RF_for_Mk2_rx.ino, as posted on the 
 * OpenEnergyMonitor forum.  That version, and other related material, can be
 * found on my Summary Page at www.openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/1757
 *
 * January 2016: renamed as remote_Mk2_receiver_1a, with a minor change in the ISR to 
 * remove a timing uncertainty.  Support for the RF69 RF module has also been included.
 *
 * January 2016: updated to remote_Mk2_receiver_1b:
 *   The variables to store the ADC results are now declared as "volatile" to remove 
 *   any possibility of incorrect operation due to optimisation by the compiler.
 *
 * February 2016: updated to remote_Mk2_receiver_2, with these changes:
 * - improvements to the start-up logic.  The start of normal operation is now 
 *    synchronised with the start of a new mains cycle.
 * - reduce the amount of feedback in the Low Pass Filter for removing the DC content
 *     from the Vsample stream. This resolves an anomaly which has been present since 
 *     the start of this project.  Although the amount of feedback has previously been 
 *     excessive, this anomaly has had minimal effect on the system's overall behaviour.
 * - change all instances of "triac" to "load"
 *
 * September 2022: updated to remoteUnit_fasterConrol_1, with this change:
 * - RF payload reduced to just one integer for the load state. For use with the transmitter
 *   sketch, Mk2_fasterControl_withRemoteLoad_n
 * - the hardware timer that controls the ADC has been increased from 200 to 250 us (just to  
 *   reduce the workload).

// Calibration
//------------
//
// powerCal is a floating point variable which is used for converting the
// product of voltage and current samples into Watts.
//
// The correct value of powerCal is dependent on the hardware that is
// in use.  For best resolution, the hardware should be configured so that the
// voltage and current waveforms each span most of the ADC's usable range.  For
// many systems, the maximum power that will need to be measured is around 3kW.
//
// My sketch "MinAndMaxValues.ino" provides a good starting point for
// system setup.  First arrange for the CT to be clipped around either core of a
// cable which supplies a suitable load; then run the tool.  The resulting values
// should sit nicely within the range 0-1023.  To allow some room for safety,
// a margin of around 100 levels should be left at either end.  This gives a
// output range of around 800 ADC levels, which is 80% of its usable range.
//
// My sketch "RawSamplesTool.ino" provides a one-shot visual display of the
// voltage and current waveforms.  This provides an easy way for the user to be
// confident that their system has been set up correctly for the power levels
// that are to be measured.
//
// The ADC has an input range of 3.3V and an output range of 1023 levels.
// The purpose of each input sensor is to convert the measured parameter into a
// low-voltage signal which fits nicely within the ADC's input range.
//
// In the case of 240V mains voltage, the numerical value of the input signal
// in Volts is likely to be fairly similar to the output signal in ADC levels.
// 240V AC has a peak-to-peak amplitude of 679V, which is not far from the ideal
// output range.  Stated more formally, the conversion rate of the overall system
// for measuring VOLTAGE is likely to be around 1 ADC-step per Volt (RMS).
//
// In the case of AC current, however, the situation is very different.  At
// mains voltage, a power of 3kW corresponds to an RMS current of 12.5A which
// has a peak-to-peak range of 35A.  This is numerically smaller than the
// output signal by around a factor of twenty.  The conversion rate of the
// overall system for measuring CURRENT is therefore likely to be around
// 20 ADC-steps per Amp.
//
// When calculating "real power", which is what this code does, the individual
// conversion rates for voltage and current are not of importance.  It is
// only the conversion rate for POWER which is important.  This is the
// product of the individual conversion rates for voltage and current.  It
// therefore has the units of ADC-steps squared per Watt.  Most systems will
// have a power conversion rate of around 20 (ADC-steps squared per Watt).
//
// powerCal is the RECIPR0CAL of the power conversion rate.  A good value
// to start with is therefore 1/20 = 0.05 (Watts per ADC-step squared)
